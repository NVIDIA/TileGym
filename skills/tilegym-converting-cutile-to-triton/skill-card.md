## Description: <br>
Converts cuTile GPU kernels (@ct.kernel) to Triton (@triton.jit), handling standard in-repo conversion, debugging (cudaErrorIllegalAddress, shape mismatch, numerical mismatch), and mapping cuTile idioms (ct.load/ct.store, ct.Constant, ct.launch) to Triton equivalents. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- `claude-code` <br>
- `codex` <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
5 evaluation tasks (1 positive activation, 4 negative activation) via NVSkills-Eval external profile in astra-sandbox environment. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies that the agent loaded the expected skill and workflow. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Checks routing quality, decoy avoidance, and redundant tool usage. <br>
- `accuracy`: Grades final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Checks whether the overall user task completed successfully. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies expected behavior steps, including safety expectations. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Compares token usage with and without the skill. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Dimension | Num | `claude-code` | `codex` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Security | 5 | 100% (+0%) | 100% (+0%) |
| Correctness | 5 | 100% (+20%) | 99% (+12%) |
| Discoverability | 5 | 100% (+20%) | 99% (+7%) |
| Effectiveness | 5 | 98% (+18%) | 96% (+15%) |
| Efficiency | 5 | 96% (+13%) | 97% (+6%) |
